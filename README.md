# Overview

A person has been kidnapped. Your job consists in creating a map showing the locations of the principal suspects to send to the police officers in charge of the case. You'll have to set the pins in order, taking a look at what the suspects have said and the evidence the officers provided. If you manage to correctly complete the map, their investigation can proceed and find the abductee. If you mess up, there's a chance they never find them. Pay attention to the suspects' testimonies and compare them with the evidence to find out what they all did that morning.
